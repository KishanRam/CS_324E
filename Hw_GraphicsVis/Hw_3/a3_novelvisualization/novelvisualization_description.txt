This program takes in the text file 'uniquewords.txt'
It creates a word cloud using the 'uniquewords.txt' file
The word cloud will fit inside a 700x600 Processing canvas
The world cloud uses the Helvetica font with a font size of 28
Helvetica was chosen due to its high readability on computer screens
Font size 28 was chosen as it was small enough to allow lots of words displayed and large enough to still be sufficiently readable
The three font colors that were chose were: blue, orange, and red
The purpose of the colors is to display the length of the words in color form
To pick the color, the following logic was used:
First, the longest word in the 'uniquewords.txt' file was found, and the length of it was recorded
Second, that length was divided by 3 to get three sections of word lengths
Small words were defined to be from 0 to (length/3) of the longest word
Medium words were defined to be from (length/3) to 2*(length/3) of the longest word
Large words were defined to be from 2*(length/3) to length of the longest word
In essence, the program assigns a color based on the length of the current word compared to the longest word in the text file
This color choice was used so that the frequency of long vs short words can be compared for a book, and this lets you see the average complexities of words in a novel

No errors or unresolved issues were present
No additional software is used, and the built in Helvetica font was used for this project
